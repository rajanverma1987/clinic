This is the flow of telemedicine video call.

1. When video call appointment is booked. patient should get an email with video link and timing detail.
2. when either of patient or doctor opens that link. after clicking "Join Video call". if A havent joined yet. User B should get message that "Waiting for user a to join the call". 
3. Once User A join the call. Both should connect and start their call.

Bugs and Improvements
1. Chat didnt work. User A and User B didnt receive each other's messages.
2. Screen is showing as mirron screen to other user
3. Make the screen responsive to fit everything on mobile screen without scrolling.
4. For Doctors. when call is join, Share button hides.
