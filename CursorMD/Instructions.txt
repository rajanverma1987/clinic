it worked perfectly when i run it on prod with https. here is what more i want to add in telemedecin video call page. 

You are building a production-grade telemedicine video call screen. Implement the following security and compliance features strictly:

1. End-to-end encryption using WebRTC Insertable Streams wherever supported.
2. Enforce authenticated access only using JWT or secure session tokens.
3. Generate one-time meeting links with automatic expiry.
4. Implement a waiting room where only the host can admit participants.
5. Apply role-based access control with roles: doctor, patient, admin.
6. Block joining the call unless camera and microphone permissions are granted.
7. Add screen-sharing controls with dynamic watermarking (user ID + timestamp).
8. Enable encrypted real-time chat and encrypted file transfer inside the call.
9. Disable recording by default and require explicit consent from all participants.
10. Maintain audit logs for join, leave, screen share, mute, recording, and file actions.
11. Apply API rate limiting and bot protection on all call-related endpoints.
12. Enforce IP throttling and session limits on the TURN server.
13. Rotate JWT secrets, TURN credentials, and encryption keys automatically.
14. Ensure HIPAA and GDPR compliant data handling, storage, access logs, and consent flow.
15. Improve the UI of the screen.
All implementations must be secure, scalable, and production-ready for real telemedicine usage.
